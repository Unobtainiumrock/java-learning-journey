  Write a program that reads in non-negative integers and stores and displays
  distinct numbers (i.e., if a number appears multiple times, it is stored and
  displayed only once). Your program should allow up to 1000 distinct numbers
  to be stored and displayed. Use the following algorithm (this is required!):
  Read each number and store it in an array if it is new. If the number is already in the array,
  ignore it. The user will indicate that they are done entering numbers by entering a negative
  number. Here is a sample run:

*/
import java.util.Scanner;

public class A8_1 {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Scanner input = new Scanner();
    
  }

  // Read numbers calls  boolean exists()

  // Print array



}
